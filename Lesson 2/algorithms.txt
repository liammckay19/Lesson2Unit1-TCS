Pizza the Algorithm:

(assuming ingredients have been bought)
1. mix eggs water flour
2. knead dough
3. roll dough out to circle
4. pinch edges of dough to make a small wall around the circle
5. spread tomato sauce
6. add mozzarella
7. add basil
8. put in oven at super hot (800 C)


An algorithm is a set of sub-problems that are each solvable by a line of code
and as a whole come together to solve a larger problem.

Algorithms are presented as pseudocode










Algorithm for translating Celsius to Fahrenheit

1) Get a temperature input in degrees celsius from the user.
2) Use our formula to calculate fahrenheit temperature.
3) Tell the user the temperature in degrees fahrenheit.



This breaks our original problem into 3 smaller problems. We could
further break each of these into even more simple problems.

1a) Get input from user
1b) Evaluate input as number
1c) Save number into a variable
2a) Calculate fahrenheit temperature with given formula 2b) Save fahrenheit temperature into a variable
3a) Print message explaining our calculation
3b) Print value of fahrenheit variable
